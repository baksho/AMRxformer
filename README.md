# Predciting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) using Encoder-only Transformer architecture: A comparative evaluation

Predict antomicrobial resistance (AMR) for a pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus) against an antibiotic (Cefoxitin) using encoder-only transformer given the genomic sequence of one of its genes (gene pbp4) as input.
