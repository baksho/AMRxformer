# Predciting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) using Encoder-only Transformer architecture: A comparative evaluation

Predict antomicrobial resistance (AMR) for a pathogen (_Staphylococcus aureus_) against the antibiotic _Cefoxitin_ using encoder-only transformer given the genomic sequence of one of its genes (_pbp4_) as input.
